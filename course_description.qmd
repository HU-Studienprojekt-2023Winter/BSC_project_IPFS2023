## Introduction

The goal of the final project is for you to use scientific analysis to analyze a data set of your own. Be aware the **phenotyping takes time**, plan your schedule in advance!

The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.

All analyses must be done in RStudio, and all components of the project **must be reproducible** (share it on Github).
